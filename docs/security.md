# Security Architecture

## Deployment posture

Riviamigo is not approved for direct Internet exposure. Production Compose binds
the application behind a host firewall and authenticated gateway, and every shared deployment must place
an authenticated tunnel or identity-aware reverse proxy in front of it. The
outer gateway owns public TLS, certificate renewal, identity enforcement, and
Internet-facing rate limits; Riviamigo login remains required behind it.

See the [secure deployment runbook](./runbooks/secure-deployment.md) for the
required gateway contract and verification steps.

The current internal audit evidence and release requirements are tracked in
[`docs/security-audit.md`](./security-audit.md).

Sensitive vulnerability reports must use the repository's [private GitHub
Security Advisory flow](https://github.com/bballdavis/Riviamigo/security/advisories/new).
Do not publish credentials, exploit details, production data, live telemetry, or
precise vehicle locations in public issues.

## Authentication

- JWT (RS256) with 15-minute access tokens
- 30-day HttpOnly refresh tokens, rotated on use
- API keys are SHA256-hashed, read-only, and bound to exactly one vehicle; keys
  never authorize dashboard, account, administrative, or vehicle-setting writes
- Argon2 password hashing
- Vehicle membership roles are capability boundaries: `viewer` is telemetry and
  history read-only, `manager` may run operational changes such as schedules
  and backfills, and `owner` alone manages credentials and membership.
- Protected-route bootstrap uses `POST /v1/auth/bootstrap`, which returns fresh tokens when a valid refresh cookie exists and `204 No Content` when no resumable session exists, so first-load logged-out state does not depend on a visible refresh 401.
- The web app attempts one refresh on protected 401s, then emits a single auth-expired flow: toast, session clear, redirect to `/login`, and resume to the original in-app route after successful sign-in.
- Optional OIDC SSO is configured by a super-user under **Settings > Authentication**.
  It uses the provider issuer/subject identity rather than email alone; local
  password login remains enabled by default and can be restored with the
  documented environment break-glass override.
- OIDC client secrets are write-only and encrypted when stored in the database.
  Authentication settings data is excluded from recovery packages; identity
  mappings remain, so operators must re-enter and test the provider after restore.
- OIDC does not replace the authenticated HTTPS gateway, add provider-driven
  role mapping, or make a directly exposed origin safe.

## Transport Security

- Production nginx is an HTTP origin on port 8080, published on host loopback by
  default through `RIVIAMIGO_HOST_BIND_ADDRESS`. The separate internal API listener
  needs `ALLOW_PUBLIC_ORIGIN_BIND=true` for a non-loopback bind. Neither is a public TLS endpoint.
- Public HTTPS and HSTS are enforced by the authenticated outer gateway
- `Secure` cookie flag enforced; `COOKIE_INSECURE` is local-development-only.
  The narrow `ALLOW_INSECURE_LAN_HTTP_AUTH=true` production exception accepts
  only documented private literal-IP HTTP origins and emits a startup warning.

## Rate Limiting

- Riviamigo applies class-specific auth, read, write, and heavy-read limits
- The authenticated outer gateway must apply its own client-facing limits
- The internal origin does not trust arbitrary forwarded client-IP headers

## Headers

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; ...`

## Database

- PostgreSQL accessible only on internal Docker network (not exposed to host)
- Parameterized queries via sqlx (compile-time checked)
- Telemetry column names validated against allowlist before interpolation
- Rivian vehicle credentials are encrypted with age before durable storage

## Secret Storage

- Durable Rivian credential bundles are encrypted before storage in `riviamigo.vehicle_credentials`
- Short-lived connect / OTP staging data should stay encrypted at rest in Redis and Redis should remain internal-only
- Production requires externally provisioned `AGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`,
  and `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` (direct values or mutually exclusive `_FILE` sources).
  Startup validates the AGE identity and RSA pair and refuses missing/partial keys.
  Database key storage is limited to explicit local development.
- A public AGE recipient in `system_config` detects accidental replacement. Existing
  DB private key rows require the explicit, transactional [custody migration](./runbooks/key-custody.md).
  It authenticates stored ciphertexts and preserves their bytes before removing only
  the matched key rows. A failed migration leaves the originals intact.
- External keys need independent protected backups. Logical row removal does not
  erase older raw dumps, snapshots, PostgreSQL pages, or WAL containing legacy keys.
  Runtime/host compromise can still expose in-memory keys; separate custody reduces
  database-only compromise risk and does not make a perfect-security claim.

## Audit Logging

- Security events (first-owner claim, login success/failure, password changes,
  account-invitation operations, API-key create/revoke/rotate, and user
  administration) are recorded in `riviamigo.security_events`.
- Each current event has an event type, actor when known, stable target,
  UUID request correlation when supplied, success/failure outcome, and
  redacted enum-like metadata. The service must not store credentials, tokens,
  email addresses, locations, or raw telemetry in this audit metadata.
- There is currently **no automatic retention/deletion job** for security
  events. Retention is therefore bounded by the operator's database retention
  and backup policy, not by an application purge interval.
- Owner-started ingestion captures are stored in
  `riviamigo.vehicle_ingestion_capture_events`. They hold sanitized ingestion
  facts, decoded values, and raw Parallax payload bytes for topics that cannot
  carry location or network identity. A key filter removes vehicle IDs, VINs,
  names, coordinates, and credential-like fields before storage and again on
  export. Each vehicle keeps one capture, which stops after one hour and is
  purged 24 hours after it stops.
- Structured `[riviamigo][LEVEL]` key-value logs are written to stdout/stderr; Docker supplies the outer timestamp. The production wrapper normalizes Nginx error lines into the same shape.

## Security regression controls

- `pnpm security:routes` verifies that every API route module is mounted through
  the intended protected router composition. The authentication module must
  have separate public, metadata, and protected mounts.
- Restore capability tokens and agent keys are compared without early-exit
  string equality and reject oversized or malformed authentication headers.
- Dynamic telemetry and metric selectors reject control characters and bounded
  oversized input before their allowlists are used to build SQL identifiers.

## Dependencies

- Weekly automated dependency audits via Dependabot
- `cargo audit --deny warnings` in CI
- `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=high` in CI
- Semgrep SAST is blocking on trusted branches and same-repository pull
  requests; fork pull requests use a separate secret-free blocking scan.
- Fixable critical and high Trivy findings are blocking after the unified production image builds; unfixed base-image findings remain visible for review and base-digest refreshes.
- Workflow actions are pinned to reviewed commit SHAs.

## Release Images

- Standard Compose pulls one public unified image from GitHub Container Registry; source builds use the explicit build overlay only.
- Stable images use immutable Calendar Version tags and provenance attestations; `latest` is a moving convenience tag, not a reproducible deployment identifier.
- Versioned container images are published only by intentional release workflows from validated `main` tags or the current `dev` pre-release candidate. The manually dispatched candidate workflow may also move the mutable `:dev` alias after it verifies the exact current upstream `dev` SHA; this alias is for development and test environments, not production release identity. Manual Candidate image dispatches may publish unversioned, commit-addressed build candidates; these are cache/release inputs, not releases. Stable and pre-release image tags and digests must be treated as release artifacts.
- See the [release images runbook](./runbooks/release-images.md) for package visibility, tag protection, and recovery requirements.

## Production Checklist
