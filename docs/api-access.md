# Riviamigo integration API

Riviamigo integration keys are read-only, bearer tokens scoped to one vehicle.
Create and revoke them in **Settings > API Access**. The secret is shown once;
store it in the integration's secret store rather than in a dashboard or source
file.

New keys expire after 90 days by default. Creation accepts `expires_in_days`
from 1 through 365. Rotating a supported read key creates a new 90-day key and
shortens the old key to a 24-hour overlap; replace the secret in the consuming
integration before that overlap ends. Creation and rotation return the new
secret once only.

Older records without `expires_at` are reported as `legacy_no_expiry` and
continue to authenticate only if they are otherwise valid read keys. Treat that
state as migration debt: rotate the key to move it onto the current 90-day
expiry policy. Legacy `view`, `edit`, and `admin` access-level records are
shown as `legacy_unmigrated` and are not treated as integration read access.

The Settings inventory preserves legacy `view`, `edit`, or `admin` values as
`legacy_unmigrated` compatibility state while the database catches up. Those
values are never treated as read access; restart the current API build so its
pending migrations can normalize them, or rotate the affected key.

The API is intentionally not an automation or dashboard-management API.
Connecting a Rivian account, changing vehicle settings, creating dashboards,
and every administrative operation require a signed-in browser session.

Chart management follows the same session-only boundary. The signed-in web app
uses `/v1/charts`, `/v1/charts/effective`, `/v1/chart-sources`, and the chart
clone, placement, enabled, reset, and admin restore routes. Integration keys do
not read or mutate chart definitions.

Integration keys use the same bounded-feed philosophy as the dashboard data
paths: a small typed inventory, explicit vehicle scope, server-side time and
point limits, and specialized responses for dense history. They do not imply
access to arbitrary JSON paths or retained inbound Rivian payloads.

External provider policy follows that same boundary. Signed-in users can read `GET /v1/settings/external-connections`; administrator or super-user sessions are required for `PUT /v1/settings/external-connections/{id}`, `POST /v1/settings/external-connections/{id}/test`, and `POST /v1/settings/external-connections/disable-optional`. Provider secrets are accepted on writes but never returned.

## Authentication and scope

Send the key with every request:

```powershell
$apiKey = 'rmigo_REPLACE_ME'
$baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3001'
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $apiKey" }
```

The key can read only the vehicle selected when it was created. Requests for a
different `vehicle_id` return `403 Forbidden`, and `GET /v1/vehicles` returns
only the scoped vehicle. Keys never authorize `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`.
`POST /v1/metrics/batch` is permitted because it is a bounded read query.

## Machine-readable catalog

Use the catalog as the current endpoint index. It requires the same bearer key
and is generated from the server's integration-read policy:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $headers -Uri "$baseUrl/v1/api/catalog"
```

The catalog includes method, path template, whether a vehicle scope is
required, and purpose. It deliberately omits session-only and administrative
routes.

## Read surface

| Group | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Vehicle | `GET /v1/vehicles`; `/v1/vehicles/{id}/status`, `/images`, `/raw-data`, `/telemetry/lanes`, `/health`, `/idle-drain`, `/parked-energy`, `/state-timeline`, `/locations`, `/live-session`, `/charging-schedule`, `/departure-schedules`, `/wallboxes`, `/ota-details`, and `/backfill-status` |
| Battery | `GET /v1/battery/soc`, `/range`, `/capacity`, `/health`, `/mileage`, `/phantom-drain`, `/degradation` |
| Metrics | `GET /v1/metrics/catalog`, `/value`, `/series`; `POST /v1/metrics/batch` |
| Trips | `GET /v1/trips`, `/trips/map`, and `/trips/{id}` with `/detail`, `/track`, `/speed`, `/elevation`, `/power`, or `/series`; `GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/drives/{trip_id}/power` is the path-scoped power alias. Vehicle members may read `/v1/vehicles/{id}/trip-tags`; owners and managers may create, update, delete, and batch-assign those shared tags. |
| Charging | `GET /v1/charging`, `/summary`, `/chart-series`, `/curve-analysis`, and individual session/curve routes; path-scoped aliases are available below `/v1/vehicles/{id}/charging-sessions` and `/costs`. Managers may patch a session with additive `location_mode` (`automatic`, `saved_place`, `none`) and `cost_mode` (`automatic`, `free`, `manual`); legacy `{ place_id }` requests remain supported. `GET/PATCH /v1/vehicles/{id}/charging-networks` exposes only networks already observed for that vehicle and lets managers mark their automatic cost as Free. |
| Efficiency | `GET /v1/efficiency/summary`, `/by-mode`, `/by-tag`, `/trend`, `/vs-temp`, `/range-vs-temp` |
| Overview | `GET /v1/dashboard/overview/{vehicle_id}` and `GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/live-session` |
| Grafana compatibility | `GET /v1/grafana`; `POST /v1/grafana/search`, `/query`, `/annotations`, `/tag-keys`, `/tag-values` |

`GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/live-session` returns `200` with the latest ephemeral
charging snapshot while the vehicle is actively charging. It returns `204` when
no Redis snapshot exists; live snapshots are refreshed by the ingestion worker
from Rivian's `chargingSession` WebSocket subscription and expire after 120
seconds without a successful refresh. Existing nullable fields remain stable;
newer snapshots may also include `charge_rate_kph`, `time_elapsed_seconds`,
`price`, `currency`, `is_free_session`, `vehicle_charger_state`, and
`started_at`. Missing upstream values remain `null` rather than being replaced
with zeroes.

Charging-session list and detail responses also expose a live projection while
`ended_at` is `null`: current SoC, power, charger state/status, elapsed and
remaining time, accumulated energy/range, and the latest charge estimate are
returned alongside the canonical row. The session curve is readable during an
open session and is bounded through the latest observed time. `cost_usd` remains
`null` until canonical session finalization; `live_current_price` is the
optional in-progress estimate.

Trip detail responses include a `power` metadata object. Its `source` is
`direct`, `estimated_soc`, or `unavailable`; estimated samples are signed net
pack power in kW (positive discharge, negative net regeneration) and include
the median/p90 SoC interval plus estimated coverage. The `/power` and `/series`
responses carry the same provenance per point through `estimated_net_power_kw`
and `power_source`. Estimated values are averaged between SoC updates and do
not represent short acceleration or braking peaks.

Efficiency endpoints accept the same `tag_ids`, `tag_match` (`all` by default
or `any`), and `untagged` filters as trip history. `GET /v1/efficiency/by-tag`
groups the selected trip cohort by every assigned tag and includes a nullable
`tag_id` `Untagged` row where applicable; rows are not additive for trips with
multiple tags. `POST /v1/metrics/batch` accepts the same fields and applies
them only to trip-derived metrics.

## Raw telemetry explorer

`GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/telemetry/lanes` is the preferred high-density history
surface. It returns a bounded, server-bucketed time spine plus explicitly
allowlisted numeric lanes (`battery`, `drive`, `location`, `climate`,
`charging`, and `health`). Select up to four lanes with `lanes`, choose
`resolution=auto|1m|5m|1h`, and cap the response with `max_points` (64-512).
The response is designed for charts and map-adjacent views; it is approximate
when bucketed and preserves sparse values as nulls.

`GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/raw-data` remains the compatibility and detail surface.
It keeps the normalized `samples` array and supports `from`, `to`, `page`,
`per_page` (or legacy `limit`), `search`, comma-separated `fields`, and
`populated_only=true`. Its `field_coverage` response is a typed array of
`{ field, sample_count }` records, not a wide dynamically constructed JSON
object. Pages should use the lane surface for dense visualization and this
surface for searchable records or selected-record inspection.

The exact inbound Rivian websocket stream is intentionally separate: signed-in vehicle owners and managers can list retained event metadata at `GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/raw-events` and fetch a single payload at `GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/raw-events/{event_id}`. These session-only routes are excluded from integration-key access and expose their configured retention period in the list response.

Owners and managers can record an ingestion capture for a vehicle. `GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/ingestion-diagnostics` returns the latest capture's `state` (`idle`, `capturing`, or `stopped`), `started_at`, `ends_at`, `stopped_at`, `stop_reason` (`user` or `expired`), `event_count`, `last_event_at`, and `truncated`. `POST /v1/vehicles/{id}/ingestion-diagnostics/start` starts a capture for a non-demo vehicle linked to a Rivian account, replacing the previous one; it stops on its own after one hour. `POST /v1/vehicles/{id}/ingestion-diagnostics/stop` ends it early. `GET /v1/vehicles/{id}/ingestion-diagnostics/export` downloads the latest capture as `application/x-ndjson`: a header line, then one line per event. Each vehicle keeps only its latest capture, which is deleted 24 hours after it stops, and exports never contain the vehicle ID, VIN, names, coordinates, or credentials. These session-only routes are unavailable to integration keys.

All historical endpoints accept a bounded timeframe where applicable. Use UTC
RFC 3339 timestamps and URL-encode query parameters.

## Running application version

Signed-in browser sessions can read `GET /v1/app/version`, which returns
`{"version":"2026.09.4+dev"}` for a development build or the stamped release
version for a tagged build. The value comes from image build metadata. When an
image has no version metadata, the endpoint returns `{"version":"unknown"}`;
it does not report the package version as if that were the running image.
Integration API keys cannot access this session-only endpoint.

## Installation-wide GitHub release-check settings

Signed-in browser sessions read `GET /v1/settings/update-check`, which returns
`{"enabled":false,"frequency":"daily"}` on a fresh or upgraded installation.
`PUT /v1/settings/update-check` accepts the same fields; only administrators and
super users can change them. Supported frequencies are `hourly`, `daily`,
`weekly`, and `monthly` (30 days). These session-only routes are unavailable to
integration API keys.

Raw Rivian WebSocket event payloads, vehicle membership lists, invitations, and
all configuration routes remain session-only. They are diagnostic or account
management surfaces rather than a stable integration contract.

## Examples

List the scoped vehicle and save its ID:

```powershell
$vehicle = (Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $headers -Uri "$baseUrl/v1/vehicles").vehicles[0]
$vehicleId = $vehicle.id
```

Read a state-of-charge series:

```powershell
$from = '2026-07-01T00:00:00Z'
$to = '2026-07-14T23:59:59Z'
Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $headers `
  -Uri "$baseUrl/v1/battery/soc?vehicle_id=$vehicleId&from=$from&to=$to"
```

Read bounded dashboard metrics:

```powershell
$body = @{
  vehicle_id = $vehicleId
  from = $from
  to = $to
  metrics = @(
    @{ metric = 'odometer_miles'; include_latest = $true; include_series = $false }
    @{ metric = 'avg_efficiency'; include_latest = $true; include_series = $true }
  )
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4

Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Headers $headers -ContentType 'application/json' `
  -Body $body -Uri "$baseUrl/v1/metrics/batch"
```

## Prometheus is separate

The REST integration API is for structured and historical vehicle data. A
future Prometheus/OpenMetrics exporter should expose only current gauges and
application health, with low-cardinality labels; it should not expose raw
telemetry, trips, locations, or dashboard configuration. See
[`docs/roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for that planned exporter work.

## Verification

The optional live contract test uses `VITE_RIVIAMIGO_DEV_API_KEY`:

```powershell
pnpm --filter @riviamigo/web test -- src/test/liveApi.contract.test.ts
```
