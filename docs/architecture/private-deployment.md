# Private deployment integration

This fork keeps the dashboard layout and upstream services while isolating deployment
policy. Modularity reduces the code that must be reconciled; it cannot eliminate
review of authentication, persistence or restore changes.

## Stable boundaries

| Module                                                         | Responsibility                                                                          | Integration point                                                                |

| `compose/nginx/security-headers.conf` and origin-gate renderer | Browser policy and mandatory gateway secret                                             | Shared nginx includes and server gate                                            |

These are compiled boundaries, not dynamically loaded plugins. A configuration
switch cannot bypass vehicle command blocking, key custody or enrollment authority.
Rivian credentials retain Rivian's own permissions: the app's query-only policy is
not an independently issued read-only Rivian token.

Session-family rotation/replay revocation, request quotas, bounded recovery and
DNS-pinned optional clients remain upstream implementations. Remaining fork hooks
include permanent API-key revocation on account disablement, deletion cleanup and
live authorization before every telemetry delivery plus a five-second idle check.
Tests must accompany upstream edits to these hooks. Never use an automatic
"prefer ours" merge driver for security files.

The audit against integrated upstream dev `b38f2a1f` at fork `cf6e1be` found
29 existing backend runtime Rust files still modified, excluding test files.
Those differences include ingestion and bug fixes as well as security hooks.
Moving policy into modules reduces overlap; it does not remove integration
points or prove that the next upstream merge will be conflict-free. Confidence
comes from the tested behavior of a specific commit, not a percentage guarantee
about future updates.

## Optional weather estimates

Weather is disabled on fresh installs. An administrator can enable the existing
Open-Meteo connection in remote mode. This fork enforces approximate coordinates
(two decimal places, roughly 1 km latitude); exact precision, custom servers,
provider credentials and private networks are rejected. Existing incompatible
settings fail closed. Re-enabling the approved profile clears old weather-provider
credentials and restores its fixed public endpoints.

The private weather module permits only Open-Meteo's free forecast and archive
endpoints. Each request contains one rounded location, at most two calendar dates
covering a trip no longer than 24 hours, and the outside-temperature variable.
It sends no Rivian token, account details, vehicle identifier, trip identifier or
raw route. Open-Meteo still receives rounded locations, dates and the server IP;
rounding is reduced precision, not anonymity against inference.

A database-backed atomic quota admits at most 200 requests per UTC day, with
admissions at least five seconds apart, shared by enrichment and administrator tests. Failed requests
consume quota. Work resumes after the daily limit resets; large backlogs can take
multiple days. One location and one variable per request keep usage below the
personal non-commercial free service's published limits. The module cannot switch
to a paid endpoint or send an API key. Provider availability and free-service terms
are external dependencies, not an uptime guarantee.

Weather jobs refresh their heartbeat after each bounded request. Jobs left running
by an interrupted deployment return to pending after 15 minutes without progress.
Pausing weather or waiting for request capacity does not exhaust the job's retry
allowance.

DNS pinning, public-address validation, disabled redirects/proxies, a 64 KiB
response limit and validated temperature/time arrays apply to every request.
Estimated samples populate the existing weather table and trip temperature/source
fields. Vehicle temperature readings take priority. Distance, energy, raw GPS,
battery readings and base Wh/mi are unchanged; temperature-based charts gain
additional context.

No migration, workflow, Cloudflare change or new paid resource is needed.
Candidate tests and protected-branch CI still gate the existing Northflank
backup/deployment workflow. New database regressions use the existing
`authorization_` CI test selection. Other optional backend providers remain denied;
the separate free map proxy is unchanged.

## Immutable migration ledger

The deployed fork has upstream migrations 1–27 and private checkpoint migration 28.
Upstream independently allocated 28 for release-check settings. Renumbering an
already-applied migration or rewriting its checksum would corrupt the upgrade and
backup compatibility contract.

The checkpoint SQL has therefore moved byte-for-byte to `migrations-private` and
keeps ledger version 28, description and checksum. Upstream SQL remains unchanged
under `migrations`. The catalog adapter maps upstream versions 28 and higher to
`1_000_000 + source_version`. The integrated versions are 1000028, 1000029 and 1000030. All earlier ledger identities stay unchanged. Future upstream migration
31 becomes 1000031 and appends normally.

The adapter intentionally accepts exactly the one legacy private migration. New
private schema changes require explicit namespace/order review; do not silently
append a private migration that would break the ordered prefix used by restores.
Upstream source versions outside 1–999999 fail closed. All migration users, including
fixtures and backup manifests, must consume the shared composed catalog.

Run `node scripts/fork-migration-integrity.mjs <previous-fork-SHA>` to compare
ordered identities. The upstream integrity script describes the upstream SQL
sequence; use the fork check when comparing a previously deployed fork. This
catalog targets fork databases, not an arbitrary upstream database that already
applied upstream version 28 under its original number.

## Upgrade and rollback

Use an immutable tested candidate image. Preserve external RSA and AGE keys and
take a pre-upgrade database backup. Test an upgrade of populated synthetic data,
new backup/restore and authentication before changing production.

After this upgrade the previous binary will reject the new ledger. Rollback must
restore the pre-upgrade database with the original keys and prior image; rolling
back the image alone is not a supported rollback. Archive the exact migration
ledger and backup metadata with the deployment record, outside Git if it contains
private information.

The daily process and its activation/promotion controls are documented in
[private fork maintenance](../runbooks/private-fork-maintenance.md). GitHub
prepares eligible stable candidates with trusted Git plumbing, runs genuine
candidate CI without deployment credentials, and advances the protected branch
only after rechecking the merge and its checks. Protected-branch CI then queues
the native Northflank backup/deployment workflow. Sensitive controls, migrations,
conflicts and failed checks stop for review; KiRoom is an optional review tool.
