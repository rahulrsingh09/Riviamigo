# Configuration

The standard Compose file reads the repository-root `.env` inside the unified app container. Keep real values out of Git and use a secret manager where your host supports one.

Start with [`compose/.env.example`](../../compose/.env.example). It contains only the three values a normal installation needs. [`compose/.env.full.example`](../../compose/.env.full.example) is the complete override template, while the [environment-variable reference](../environment-variables.md) documents every supported value, default, and scope.

## Required for production

Set these before starting `compose/docker-compose.yml`:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — a strong database password; the app safely constructs its internal database URL from it.
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` — a separate strong password.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — the exact public HTTPS origin used by your authenticated gateway, such as `https://riviamigo.example.net`.

Riviamigo defaults to production mode; no production flag is required in `.env`.

On first startup, Riviamigo generates its JWT signing pair and age encryption
identity and stores them in PostgreSQL. They therefore survive normal restarts
and recovery-package restores. This database-key arrangement is an explicitly
accepted **P2 shared-fate risk**: database loss or compromise can also affect
locally generated application keys. Advanced deployments that require separate
key custody may supply `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`, and
`AGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` together from a secret manager; partial overrides are
rejected. Maintain and test recovery of that external secret source. Rotating
the age key without migrating encrypted values can make stored credentials
unreadable.

### Production first owner

Before the first production registration, set exactly one setup proof:

- `RIVIAMIGO_SETUP_TOKEN` for a securely injected value, or
- `RIVIAMIGO_SETUP_TOKEN_FILE` for a mounted secret file (preferred).
Synology uses the same `compose/.env.example` template and universal Compose
file as every other Docker host. The template leaves the setup token commented
out so an unclaimed production stack fails closed until a unique proof is
configured.

The proof must contain at least 32 bytes. The first registration sends it as
`setup_token`; the app uses it only while no user exists. The public setup
status intentionally reveals only whether a proof is required and available,
not its source or value. Without a proof, an unclaimed production stack stays
healthy but fails closed for registration. Remove or rotate the bootstrap secret
after the first owner is created. See the [environment reference](../environment-variables.md)
for the exact variable contract.

## Optional settings

Weather, geocoding, basemap, and Iconify policies are configured in **Settings > External Connections** and stored in the database. Do not add provider URLs or API keys to `.env`; custom connection secrets are encrypted with the installation age key and remain write-only. See [external connections](./external-connections.md).

- `RIVIAMIGO_ORIGIN_PORT` changes the published app port from `8080`.
- `RIVIAMIGO_HOST_BIND_ADDRESS` controls Docker's host-side published address;
  it defaults to `127.0.0.1`. A gateway on the same Docker network can reach
  container port 8080 without host publication. Remote-gateway publication
  requires an explicit interface override and firewall rule.
- `RIVIAMIGO_BIND_ADDRESS` controls the application's internal listener and
  defaults to `127.0.0.1`; it is not the Docker host publication address. A
  non-loopback internal listener requires `ALLOW_PUBLIC_ORIGIN_BIND=true`.
- `IMAGE_TAG` selects a published release and defaults to `latest`.
- `RIVIAMIGO_IMAGE_REGISTRY` defaults to `ghcr.io/bballdavis`.
- `RIVIAMIGO_IMAGE` overrides both values with one complete reference. Use the
  `ghcr.io/bballdavis/riviamigo@sha256:...` value from `images.lock` when an
  installation must pull the exact verified release manifest.
- `BACKUP_DRIVER`, `BACKUP_ARTIFACT_DIR`, and `BACKUP_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` tune recovery packages; normal Compose already uses `/backups`.
- `TZ` sets the Docker/container timezone for nginx and other runtime processes. It is separate from the shared user-facing application timezone configured under **Settings > Units**.
- Reconnect, telemetry-retention, logging, and rate-limit settings are available in the [complete reference](../environment-variables.md).

For optional single sign-on, follow the [OIDC single sign-on guide](./oidc-sso.md).
It explains the **Settings > Authentication** workflow, field-level environment
overrides, and the break-glass recovery path before password login is disabled.

## Local HTTP development

The local development stack is started with `pnpm dev:stack` and uses
`compose/docker-compose.dev.yml`. It deliberately sets:

```dotenv
RIVIAMIGO_ENV=development
COOKIE_INSECURE=true
```

The development stack runs over HTTP. `COOKIE_INSECURE=true` makes the
`HttpOnly` refresh cookie usable by the browser on that HTTP origin, so a page
refresh can resume the session instead of requiring another login. This is not
an HTTPS substitute: leave the variable unset for the standard production
Compose stack, which keeps refresh cookies `Secure`. If you run the
production-like Compose file locally over HTTP, set both values in an
untracked local env file and do not reuse that file for production. Existing
local env files using `1` or `0` must be updated to `true` or `false`.

The active `.env` and `.env.local` files remain ignored by Git.
