# Verify the installation

Verify the runtime before exposing it through a gateway or treating the installation as recoverable. Complete these checks after the first start and after significant deployment changes.

## Check container health

From the repository root, inspect the production stack:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f compose/docker-compose.yml ps
```

The unified app, database, and Redis services should be running, and services with health checks should become healthy. Riviamigo's app health check verifies its Redis-backed secure-session store, so it remains unhealthy if Redis is unreachable or rejects the configured password. If a service is restarting or unhealthy, inspect its recent logs before changing configuration:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f compose/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=200
```

For one service, append its Compose service name to the logs command.

For a secure-session failure, inspect the Riviamigo logs for `secure_session_store.unavailable` and confirm the app and Redis containers use the same current `REDIS_PASSWORD`; do not expose either password in a terminal, ticket, or log. Correct the configuration and restart through your normal deployment workflow. The app must become healthy before attempting owner or vehicle setup.

## Check the private origin

Open `http://localhost:8080` from the host. The login or first-owner setup screen should load; use a host firewall and authenticated gateway before exposing it remotely.

If the page does not load:

1. Confirm the web and API services are healthy.
2. Confirm another process is not occupying the configured origin port.
3. Review the web and API logs.
4. Recheck required values in [Configuration](./configuration.md).

## Create and confirm the first owner

The first completed account setup becomes the installation owner. After signing in:

- Confirm the session survives a normal page refresh.
- Open Settings and confirm owner-only administration surfaces are available.
- In **Settings → Account**, confirm the password form shows its live 12-character requirement before attempting a change. A completed password change signs out every browser session; sign in again with the replacement password.
- Do not create additional users until the first owner and access boundary are verified.

## Confirm Rivian connectivity

Follow [Rivian account setup](./rivian-account.md), then confirm:

- The connected vehicle appears in the vehicle selector.
- The completion screen first confirms that the vehicle was saved, then reports
  whether the telemetry collector is starting, connected, or needs attention.
- Current vehicle status eventually appears after Rivian authentication succeeds;
  a container restart should not be required.
- Sleeping vehicles are allowed time to report; missing immediate telemetry is not automatically an installation failure.
- If the vehicle was saved but telemetry does not start, open the dashboard's
  vehicle health details and inspect the app logs instead of repeating OTP or
  restarting the entire stack.
- Persistent authentication or MFA errors are handled through the Rivian connection flow.

## Check trip capture recovery

Container health confirms the secure-session store is reachable; it does not
guarantee vehicle connectivity or trip capture. The authenticated
`GET /v1/vehicles/{vehicle_id}/health` response includes `trip_capture`.
Its `ready` flag requires a connected, authorized collector, a heartbeat within
60 seconds, a saved detector checkpoint, and no pending trip writes. Parked
vehicles do not need to emit continuous trip samples to remain ready.

If `pending_completions` stays above zero or `persistence_error` is present,
inspect application logs for `trip checkpoint failed` or
`completed trip persistence failed`. Check database connectivity and available
storage. Keep the checkpoint and pending-completion tables intact: they hold
the recovery state. Successful DB writes clear pending completions automatically;
restarting repeatedly or rebuilding trip history is not a repair procedure.
An exited collector retries automatically, with delays capped at five minutes.
An offline upstream can leave readiness false while the application stays
healthy; do not configure container restarts from this vehicle readiness flag.

After a restart, recent active trips resume from their saved checkpoint.
Fragments whose last observation is over five minutes old end at that
observation, and later telemetry starts a separate trip. Missing telemetry is
not filled in. Trips under 0.1 mile remain filtered, and addresses may appear
later through periodic enrichment. No setup can promise every trip: if Rivian
does not deliver samples, or the app stops while the database is unavailable,
observations not yet committed may be lost. Maintain tested backups of the
database, including its checkpoint and pending-completion tables.

## Verify the gateway before remote use

After local verification, configure the authenticated HTTPS gateway described in [Secure deployment](./secure-deployment.md). From the final public address, confirm:

- HTTPS is valid.
- Authentication is required before Riviamigo is reachable.
- Normal API requests succeed after sign-in.
- Live vehicle updates do not show WebSocket connection failures. Leave the
  dashboard open beyond the gateway's idle window, background and refocus the
  tab, and confirm a temporary `Reconnecting...` state recovers to `Online`
  without a hard refresh.
- Host firewall rules and the authenticated gateway protect port 8080 from direct public access.

## Establish a recovery baseline

Once the installation is healthy and connected, follow [Backup and restore](./backup-and-restore.md) to create and verify the first recovery package. A running dashboard without a tested recovery package is not a complete installation.
