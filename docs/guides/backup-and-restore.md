# Backup and restore

Backup creation, preflight and restore staging use the configured backup
storage volume. Provision room there for the package, extracted database dump
and safety backup; the service preserves at least 2 GiB of free space by
default. Temporary recovery work is removed when the operation finishes.

Chart definitions, personal overrides, dashboard placements, and chart baseline metadata are included in the PostgreSQL backup. A restore keeps compatible chart records and rejects a newer unsupported definition with a visible compatibility error rather than silently dropping it.

Riviamigo recovery packages are full durable-state packages. They include the PostgreSQL database and the persistent vehicle artwork cache, so a downloaded package can be restored into a clean installation running the same or a newer Riviamigo release.

Redis live snapshots, browser storage, refresh sessions, Rivian/provider credentials, OIDC authentication settings and client secrets, provider connection activity history, installation keys, and backup target secrets are intentionally not restored. OIDC identity mappings remain in PostgreSQL. The restore pipeline recreates the authentication-settings singleton with OIDC off, password login on, and no provider secret; sign in with a preserved local super-user password, then re-enter and test the provider settings. Non-secret backup scheduling and target configuration is restored; reconnect providers and re-enter the backup target secret after a restore. During an in-place restore, Riviamigo preserves the host's backup catalog, backup execution history, and restore request history outside PostgreSQL and merges them into the restored database after startup. A clean installation can rebuild its S3 catalog from the configured bucket.

## Create and download a recovery package

Open **Settings > Backups** and enable Local, S3, or both. Local retains a `.rma.tar.gz` package under `./data/backups`; S3 uploads the same verified package to the configured bucket and prefix. At least one destination is required. Use **Test S3 connection** after saving S3 settings to prove list, write, read, and delete access before relying on the schedule. Backup times use the shared application timezone configured by an administrator under **Settings > Units > Time zone**.

If S3 is an enabled destination and its upload fails, the run is marked failed and Riviamigo retains the valid package locally even when Local retention was disabled. This prevents a remote-storage outage from silently appearing as a protected backup.

Selecting **Run now** starts the backup asynchronously and returns immediately. The Backups page polls the durable run record while the worker reports queued, dump, snapshot, packaging, validation, upload, and completion phases with progress. A second manual start is rejected while the existing run holds the backup lock. If the API restarts before a detached worker finishes, startup marks that run failed instead of leaving an indefinitely running history row.

The cutover release uses the `riviamigo-recovery-v3` contract and contains:

- `manifest.json` with the source release/build, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB versions, migration chain identifier, complete ordered migration ledger and raw-byte SHA-384 checksums, compiled catalog digest, versioned canonical schema-contract digest, component policies, redactions, sizes, and checksums.
- `database.dump`, a custom-format PostgreSQL dump with sensitive and ephemeral data excluded.
- `backup-settings.json`, containing non-secret backup schedule and target configuration.
- `operational-history.json`, containing a sanitized, independently versioned snapshot of backup runs, artifact metadata, and restore requests.
- `vehicle-image-cache/`, containing the persistent first-party vehicle artwork mirror.

The API must have `pg_dump` available. `BACKUP_DRIVER=json` is no longer a valid recovery mode and is rejected as manifest-only metadata.

## Package trust and limits

Only restore packages from a trusted producer. PostgreSQL dumps contain
executable SQL; administrator-only restore and a restricted import role reduce
risk but do not turn a package into a sandbox. Credentials, session families,
API keys and invitation proofs are discarded during restore. Authentication
returns to password login enabled and OIDC disabled, subject to operator-owned
environment overrides. Reconfigure providers and regenerate integration keys.

Manifest and settings JSON each default to a 1 MiB limit; operational history
defaults to 16 MiB and imports incrementally. Large database dumps retain their
separate 64 GiB member limit. S3 materialization uses the compressed-package,
free-space and deadline limits before extraction. A restored catalog's path or
availability flag never authorizes access outside the configured artifact root.

Custom S3 targets require HTTPS by default. An operator can explicitly allow
private CIDRs and the trusted-LAN HTTP exception through the environment
reference; backup files cannot grant themselves this permission. Prefixes are
ordinary relative paths, without traversal, hidden directories or drive names.

## Import and restore in the app

On the target installation, sign in as an administrator and open **Settings > Backups**. In **Restore from backup**, choose a package from the local catalog or select **Import recovery package** to upload a `.rma.tar.gz` file from another Riviamigo server. Wait for upload and package validation to finish. The default upload limit is 16 GiB; validation also limits expanded archive and individual-member size to 64 GiB, member count to 10,000, and compression ratio to 200:1. The artifact volume must retain at least 2 GiB free before and during import. Any tunnel or reverse proxy in front of Riviamigo must also permit streaming uploads of the package size you use.

Upload and restore share one recovery-mutation lock. A 30-minute upload deadline and four-hour restore deadline prevent an interrupted operation from holding it indefinitely. The service returns explicit too-large, insufficient-storage, validation, and deadline errors; repair the package or capacity and retry only after the active operation clears. Imported archives are streamed to a temporary file, fully validated before cataloging, and rejected for traversal/duplicate paths, unsupported members, unexpected content, or a resource-envelope breach. Operators can tighten these `RECOVERY_*` limits in the [environment reference](../environment-variables.md).

Disconnecting the browser does not release admission while validation or
extraction is still running. The admitted operation finishes its bounded work
and cleanup before another recovery operation can begin. If candidate
preparation reaches the restore deadline, the supervisor removes the candidate
and disables the temporary import credentials before releasing admission.

Select **Restore selected backup**. Riviamigo first performs an authenticated compatibility preflight and shows the source and target chain identities, schema heads, pending migrations, warnings, or a stable blocking reason. A source with an exact ledger prefix is upgraded normally. A v3 archive with historical SQLx bookkeeping may also proceed, but only after its isolated candidate matches both the archive's declared schema fingerprint and the immutable public baseline contract. Starting the restore requires that exact plan ID and package checksum. Review the replacement warning and type `RESTORE`. Riviamigo then:

1. Restores PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB into an isolated candidate while the current application remains available.
2. Verifies the actual source schema and migration ledger, reconstructs SQLx bookkeeping only inside the isolated candidate, runs pending forward migrations, and validates required relations, constraints, indexes, hypertables, policies, checksums, and foreign keys.
3. Creates and verifies a fresh safety recovery package only after the candidate is ready. The restore stops if this fails.
4. Merges source operational history with the target host snapshot; target records win UUID conflicts and the host catalogs determine physical package availability.
5. Stops the API and ingestion workers, then atomically activates the candidate database and versioned artwork directory.
6. Starts the API and verifies health, setup state, migrations, and restored data. A failed verification automatically swaps the previous database and artwork back.
7. Reconciles the durable journal and reloads the browser. Sign in with an account from the restored backup if prompted.

PostgreSQL and Redis remain running during this workflow. The durable journal checkpoints candidate preparation, transforms, migrations, validation, safety backup, history merge, swap, verification, rollback, and completion. A restart resumes an idempotent phase or rebuilds only the candidate. Retryable failures are bounded; invalid or incompatible packages are terminal.

## Restore with the host command

Prepare the new installation and its `.env` file first. Use the same or newer application release, then run the restore before using the new installation:

```bash
node scripts/restore-backup.mjs \
  --package ./backup-20260715T120000Z-<run-id>.rma.tar.gz \
  --env-file ./.env
```

For a source checkout, add `--source-build`. The command:

1. Validates the archive, manifest, checksums, and archive paths.
2. Starts only PostgreSQL and refuses a database that already contains users.
3. Runs the same Rust compatibility planner, candidate engine, transforms, migrations, and validation report used by in-app restores.
4. Creates a safety package of the target host, merges its operational history, and atomically activates the validated database and artwork while retaining the previous state.
5. Starts the unified app service, verifies health plus setup state, and finalizes the swap; a failed verification invokes the shared rollback path.

Use `--force` only when intentionally replacing the target installation:

```bash
node scripts/restore-backup.mjs \
  --package ./backup.rma.tar.gz \
  --env-file ./.env \
  --force
```

The restore picker can browse Local, S3, or both catalogs. Selecting an S3 package downloads it into protected staging, validates its package and component checksums, creates the normal safety backup, and then hands it to the restore supervisor. A clean installation can therefore configure the original bucket, discover its Riviamigo packages, and restore without first copying the archive through a browser.

The in-app flow and host command do not restore Rivian credentials or live sessions. S3 secrets are also redacted from the package. After completion, sign in as an administrator, reconnect external providers, and re-enter the S3 secret unless the deployment supplies environment-backed credentials. Restored Rivian vehicles are marked as requiring reauthentication instead of retaining stale connected state. To resume vehicle telemetry, reconnect each Rivian vehicle from Settings; this stores encrypted credentials and restarts its ingestion worker. During an active charge, the worker publishes a short-lived live snapshot for the dashboard, while the live-session endpoint returns `204` when no current snapshot is available.

## Persistent artifact storage

New production installations mount the Docker-managed `riviamigo-backups`
volume at `/backups` and use it for generated, imported, safety, remote-staging,
and restore-job artifacts. PostgreSQL uses `riviamigo-db`, while artwork uses
`riviamigo-cache`. Existing bind-mount installations keep their configured host
paths. Restore never replaces or recreates backup storage; startup and the
Backups page rescan valid local packages and rebuild any missing catalog rows
from disk. The retention count applies independently to generated Local and S3
packages. Imported and safety packages are never pruned by scheduled retention.

## Compatibility and verification

Recovery is forward-compatible through the versioned v3 schema contract. A recognized older v3 package with an exact catalog prefix is upgraded inside the isolated candidate. A v3 archive with a historical or unfamiliar ledger is never guessed at: its restored schema must match its declared fingerprint and the immutable public baseline before Riviamigo normalizes bookkeeping and applies forward migrations. Downgrades, unsupported package formats, schema-contract mismatches, incomplete schemas, incompatible PostgreSQL or TimescaleDB versions, and newer-source packages are rejected before swap.

The former five-migration pre-release chain remains a rollback path when a matching historical application image is available. A v3 archive from that era can be considered by the current restore engine only through the same candidate schema proof above; an incompatible candidate is rejected before activation. The explicit adoption command remains an operator action for a stopped installation: it verifies a recovery dump and complete canonical schema against a scratch baseline, then replaces only SQLx bookkeeping. It never replays baseline SQL on populated data and is never run automatically at startup, backup, or restore.

Matching migration numbers or visibly matching tables do not prove migration identity. The raw migration bytes, ordered catalog, chain identifier, and schema contract must all agree.

Before relying on a package, restore it into an isolated installation and verify users, dashboards, vehicles, telemetry, trips, charging history, artwork, and application health. Treat packages as sensitive because they contain account, location, and vehicle history.

For a repeatable production-data development check, use the [production-test dev harness](../runbooks/dev-harness.md). It restores a verified package into fresh test-only storage before starting the candidate image; it never reads PostgreSQL's live data directory and never downgrades a migrated test database in place.
