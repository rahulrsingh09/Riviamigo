# Rivian Auth Reference

Rivian does not publish a supported public owner API. Riviamigo follows the same
cloud API shape used by the unofficial Home Assistant Rivian integration and the
`rivian-python-client` package.

## Current Endpoints

- GraphQL gateway: `https://rivian.com/api/gql/gateway/graphql`
- Charging GraphQL: `https://rivian.com/api/gql/chrg/user/graphql`
- Vehicle state WebSocket: `wss://api.rivian.com/gql-consumer-subscriptions/graphql`

## Required Headers

Base GraphQL requests should include:

- `User-Agent: RivianApp/707 CFNetwork/1237 Darwin/20.4.0`
- `Accept: application/json`
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Apollographql-Client-Name: com.rivian.ios.consumer-apollo-ios`
- `dc-cid: m-ios-<uuid>`

After creating a CSRF session, login and OTP requests also include:

- `Csrf-Token: <csrfToken>`
- `A-Sess: <appSessionToken>`

Authenticated GraphQL requests generally use:

- `A-Sess: <appSessionToken>`
- `U-Sess: <userSessionToken>`
- `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`

The GraphQL WebSocket uses the `graphql-transport-ws` subprotocol. Its
handshake carries `A-Sess`, `U-Sess`, and `Csrf-Token`; `connection_init` also
sends `u-sess` in the payload.

The worker starts two subscriptions on the same authenticated socket: the
partial `vehicleState($vehicleID: String!)` stream and
`chargingSession($vehicleID: String!)`. The latter is the live charging source;
its `liveData` contains power, energy, range, elapsed/remaining seconds, price,
currency, and charger state, while `chartData` contains observed SoC/power
points. `getLiveSessionHistory($vehicleId: ID!)` remains a REST reconciliation
query after a session, not a replacement for the live stream.

## Login Flow

1. Call `CreateCSRFToken`.
2. Save `csrfToken` and `appSessionToken`.
3. Call `Login` with email/password and the CSRF/app-session headers.
4. If Rivian returns `MobileMFALoginResponse`, save `otpToken` plus the CSRF
   session and ask the user for the MFA code.
5. Call `LoginWithOTP` with email, `otpCode`, and `otpToken`.
6. Save `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `userSessionToken`, `appSessionToken`,
   `csrfToken`, and the creation timestamp.
7. Call `getUserInfo` against the same gateway to read
   `currentUser.vehicles[].id`, `vin`, `name`, `vehicle.modelYear`, and
   `vehicle.model`.
8. `/v1/vehicles/connect` returns those vehicle summaries. The browser must
   follow a successful connect by calling `POST /v1/vehicles`. The API reads the
   caller's encrypted temporary token bundle from Redis and calls `getUserInfo`
   again to verify the selected vehicle belongs to that account before changing
   local data. A failed lookup or a vehicle absent from the response leaves local
   membership and credentials unchanged. A new vehicle gets owner membership;
   an existing vehicle requires an existing owner or manager membership and never
   acquires a new member through enrollment. Use invitations to share local access.
   The API then persists the encrypted token bundle in
   `riviamigo.vehicle_credentials` and sets `users.default_vehicle_id` if empty.
   Concurrent enrollment of the same Rivian ID is serialized.

Refreshing credentials for an existing vehicle uses the same encrypted storage
path and immediately sends a worker-start command. This matters after a restore:
provider credentials are intentionally redacted from recovery packages, so the
vehicle can exist in PostgreSQL without a credential row. Startup still runs the
vehicle worker long enough to replace stale `authorized`/`connected` state with
an actionable `needs_reauth` status. After the user reconnects the Rivian
account, the supervisor replaces that completed worker and starts ingestion
immediately. A successful refresh should therefore be followed by worker health
and telemetry-timestamp checks, not only by an `authorized` database state.

## Advisory Renewal Policy

Riviamigo treats the durable token bundle creation time as the most recent full
Rivian authentication. The API derives `expected_renewal_at` at 180 days and a
typed `renewal_state`: `healthy`, `renewal_soon`, `renewal_due`, or
`reauth_required`. The seven-day `renewal_soon` threshold is an application
policy informed by current unofficial-client behavior, not an official Rivian
expiry guarantee. Observed credential rejection always overrides the timer.

A successful full login or OTP credential refresh resets the creation time.
Automatic CSRF/app-session renewal preserves it because that rotation does not
represent a new long-lived Rivian authorization. Do not move the advisory date
from routine WebSocket reconnects or short-lived session refreshes.

The credential-refresh route verifies the selected Rivian vehicle before
storage and rechecks the caller's enabled account and owner/manager membership
inside the write transaction. It starts the worker and waits for runtime health plus vehicle discovery
for a bounded interval. It returns `telemetry_status: connected` only after that
proof. A bounded timeout returns `waiting_for_vehicle_data` with a recoverable message while
retaining the valid encrypted credentials. The browser invalidates the vehicle,
status, and health queries and explicitly reconnects the live vehicle socket
after either result.

## Local Riviamigo Auth Gotcha

`/v1/vehicles/connect` is protected by Riviamigo's own JWT. A browser-side
`401 Unauthorized` on that route can mean the local 15-minute Riviamigo access
token expired before Rivian was contacted. The web API client retries protected
requests once after calling `/v1/auth/refresh`.

If the UI returns to "Add a Vehicle" after a successful Rivian login, check:

- Redis key `rivian:connect:<user_id>` exists: Rivian auth succeeded but has not
  been persisted.
- `riviamigo.vehicles` has no row for the user: the browser did not complete
  `POST /v1/vehicles`.
- `users.default_vehicle_id` is null: the dashboard will continue to show the
  empty vehicle state even though Rivian auth temporarily succeeded.
